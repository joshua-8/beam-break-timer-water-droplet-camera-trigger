# beam-break-timer-water-droplet-camera-trigger

// Arduino code written by ENGN0350 Art Fluid Engineering Group 5 for lab 1 February 2024
// this program waits for a button to be pressed, runs a pump for a short period of time, turns on a laser, waits for a phototransistor to detect a falling droplet, waits an adjustable amount of time, then triggers a camera and flash to take a photo
// this program was edited quickly during lab and ended up a bit messy.
